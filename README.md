# BioSCape publications

This repository has a short python script that scrapes publications from the [BioSCape Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2810748/bioscape/collections/U4SW8TCS) and publishes it as a plain HTML website for embedding on the bioscape.io website.

It automatically updates once per day.
